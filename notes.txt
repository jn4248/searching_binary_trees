combine stuff from bt test to bs test.

clean up code for show-tree:
  - can i rename stuff better?
  - can i refactor more cleanly?

test code for smaller methods?

still need to write depth search (all three? pre, post, and other?)

write test scripts for searches, now that i can show the tree.

clean up test page and organize better.

comments for code...especially show-tree

change file names from "bs..."

remove unnecessary comments and print code

...don't forget 'puts' in this one:

        def show_binary_tree
          text = tree_levels_text_array
          puts ""
          puts ""
          text.each { |row| puts row }
        end


IN the code:

        def tree_levels_text_array
          blank_node = "__"
          cell_pad = "  "
          # blank_node = "_" * max_node_value_length  # text for nil nodes
          # cell_pad = " " * max_node_value_length    # text for cell padding / spacing

        consider using the defined length, instead of calculated....
        ...or consider a minimum of the two (ie: if lenghth or 2, whichever is less)


line 109
if first_exp.integer? && second_exp.integer? && first_exp < second_exp

  .integer? a real method??

also getting an error through line 109....trying to treat 'nil' as an integer...
"no implicit conversion"


Add a note to show_binary_tree that is only good for trees up to "xx" levels


lines 102 an 103....outer or inner (with n-2) is getting nil from sum_base_to_exponent_series when trying to caluculate the spacing for level 0
